# The PDF files in this folder are Halocarbon Regulations Templates.
In other words, ODS sheets/tags.

# Industry vs Common Terms
Halocarbon Charging = Reloading a cylinder with more gas.
Notice of permanent withdrawal from use = Recovering gas and disposing of it, no longer going to reuse the gas.
Activity Log = Form you fill out when you use a cylinder for maintenance or repair of equipment.


# Paper tags stay with the unit, Excel spreadsheet forms are for long term record keeping.
 Both ODS paper tags and the digital records like those in Excel spreadsheets contain similar information. This would typically include details such as the type of refrigerant, the quantity added or removed, the date of service, and potentially the technician's information and the purpose of the service. The main difference is the format and how the information is stored and managed: paper tags are attached to the equipment and serve as a quick reference, while electronic records are stored in a database or log for more comprehensive record-keeping.
