## Med-I-Well Project Description: Should we remove this part? Seems to be from a different app.
The proposed web application will be developed using the Python based Flask micro-framework, which is known for its simplicity and flexibility. The app's codebase will be stored in a Git repository to facilitate version control and collaboration among developers. The app will be deployed to DigitalOcean using a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) process, which automates the testing, building, and deployment of the app to ensure that the app is always up-to-date and functional.
The main function of the app is to provide a form on the frontend where users or administrators can input report information, which will then be processed using Python to calculate scores and generate a web-based and downloadable PDF version of the report card. This will enable users to easily access and share their report card with others.
Additionally, the app will have different functionalities for individual users, the Med-I-Well administrator, and clients, who will have access to a dashboard. This will allow each user to have a personalized experience and access the features that are relevant to them.

Why: REFIT Canada's role is in refrigerant management. The REFiT system is an electronic solution that replaces paper forms traditionally used for logging the type and weight of refrigerants, which is crucial for maintaining accurate records​​. This kind of management is vital for ensuring that ozone-depleting substances are properly controlled and that their use is minimized to protect the ozone layer.
The project scope entails the creation of a mobile application that integrates with the QR code technology to enhance business operations, scalability, and customer experience.
