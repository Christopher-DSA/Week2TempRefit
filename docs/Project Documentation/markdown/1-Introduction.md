# Refit

## Project Description: 
The proposed web application will be developed using the Python based Flask micro-framework, which is known for its simplicity and flexibility. The app's codebase will be stored in a Git repository to facilitate version control and collaboration among developers. The app will be deployed to DigitalOcean using a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) process, which automates the testing, building, and deployment of the app to ensure that the app is always up-to-date and functional.
The main function of the app is to provide a form on the frontend where users or administrators can input report information, which will then be processed using Python to calculate scores and generate a web-based and downloadable PDF version of the report card. This will enable users to easily access and share their report card with others.
Additionally, the app will have different functionalities for individual users, the Med-I-Well administrator, and clients, who will have access to a dashboard. This will allow each user to have a personalized experience and access the features that are relevant to them.
