## Contractor Login and Registration Page

The "Contractor Login and Registration Page" is a web page designed for contractors to access their accounts through login or register for a new account. When a contractor selects the "Contractor" role, they will be directed to this page, where they have two options: "Log In" or "Register."

## Log In
If the contractor selects "Log In," they will be prompted to enter their username and password to access their existing account.

## Register
If the contractor selects "Register," they will be directed to the "Registration Form." Here, they must provide their name, email ID, password, and confirm the password. Additionally, they need to enter their company name, branch ID, address (including street address, city, province, postal code), and phone number to create a new account.
