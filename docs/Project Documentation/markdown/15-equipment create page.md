## Equipment Create Form

The "Equipment Create Form" is a web form designed for technicians to create new equipment entries. The form displays auto-populated information, including profile info, equipment tag ID, technician ID, and the create date (editable, defaulted to the current date). The technician can also edit the address, and if the organization location exists in the system, the organization's ID will be displayed.

The form dynamically populates the refrigerant ID based on the selected refrigeration type. Additionally, it calculates and displays the "Total Refrigerant Charge," which is the sum of the factory charge and additional charge.

The technician can enter the manufacturer's name, model number, serial number, equipment type, and refrigerant type. They can also input the factory charge amount (lbs) and additional refrigerant charge. If the technician selects "Yes," they can add the amount of refrigerant, which automatically updates the "Total Charge." Additionally, the form includes fields for the location description and additional notes.
