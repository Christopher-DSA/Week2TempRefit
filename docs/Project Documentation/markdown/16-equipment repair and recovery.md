## Equipment repair form

The "Repair Form" is a web form designed for technicians to document equipment repairs. The form displays auto-populated information, including the equipment tag ID, technician ID, and the repair date (editable, defaulted to the current date). It also provides details such as refrigerant ID, refrigeration type, factory charge amount of refrigerant (lbs), additional amount added (lbs), and the total refrigerant amount in the equipment (automatically calculated as the sum of factory charge and additional amount).

The form further includes fields for the equipment's model number, serial number, and ODS Sheet number. Technicians can enter test results using checkboxes with options such as repaired discharge, line on compressor, leak detected, leak repair, vacuum test performed, leak not repaired, no leak detected, no longer contains refrigerant, and compressor oil removed. Additionally, there's a checkbox labeled "Other," allowing technicians to provide specific details if none of the predefined options fit.

Upon filling out the form, the technician can click the "Submit" button. However, before submitting, the form prompts the technician to enter a unique job number, which helps identify and track the repair.
