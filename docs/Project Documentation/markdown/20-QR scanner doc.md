Overview

The Contractor Dashboard offers users multiple functionalities, one of which is a QR scanner. This feature allows for the quick and easy scanning of QR codes, with the decoded data subsequently sent to the server for further processing.

QR Scanner Library: ZXing

The dashboard uses the ZXing (Zebra Crossing) library for barcode image processing. This well-regarded library enables the reading of various barcode formats, including QR codes, directly from the browser using the device's camera.

How the QR Scanner Works

Initialization:
Upon accessing the dashboard, the QR code reader is initialized and readied for use.

Starting the Scanner:
Clicking the "Reclaim/Recover" button activates the QR code scanning process. Once activated, the camera feed becomes visible, allowing users to position a QR code for scanning.

Decoding the QR Code:
The library automatically detects and decodes any QR code presented in the camera's view. Once decoded, the result is presented on the dashboard.

Sending Decoded Data to the Server:
After the QR code is successfully decoded, the dashboard sends the decoded information to the server via a POST request. This data can then be processed further based on the application's requirements.

Error Handling:
In case of any issues during the scanning process, such as the inability to access the camera or an unrecognized QR code, a corresponding error message is displayed on the dashboard.

Conclusion
The QR scanner integrated into the Contractor Dashboard is both efficient and user-friendly. By leveraging the capabilities of the ZXing library, the dashboard ensures seamless compatibility across a wide range of devices and browsers, offering users a hassle-free scanning experience.
