## Cylinder Type Selection Form

The "Cylinder Type Selection Form" is a web form that allows users to choose between two options: "New Cylinder" or "Recovery Cylinder." Upon selection, the form dynamically redirects the user to the corresponding page for the chosen option.

## New Cylinder Option

If the user selects "New Cylinder," they will be directed to the "New Cylinder Form." This form displays auto-populated information such as cylinder tag ID, refrigerant ID, technician ID, and the select date (which defaults to the current date but can be edited). The user can then enter details such as refrigerant type, cylinder size in lbs, refrigerant weight in lbs, purchase date (if different from the manufacturer date), and wholesaler.

## Recovery Cylinder Option

If the user selects "Recovery Cylinder," they will be directed to the "Recovery Cylinder Form." This form displays non-editable details such as cylinder tag ID, company name, refrigerant ID, technician ID, and the recovery date (which defaults to the current date but can be edited). The user must then enter details such as refrigerant type, cylinder type (with options: clean/reuse, non-usable, and burnout), cylinder size in lbs, and refrigerant type in lbs.
